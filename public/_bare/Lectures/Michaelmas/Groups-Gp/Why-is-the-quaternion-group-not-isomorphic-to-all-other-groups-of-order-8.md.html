<p>
    <span class="inline-math">$Q_8$</span> is not abelian so it cannot be isomorphic to <span class="inline-math">$C_8, C_4\times C_2, C_2\times C_2\times C_2$</span>, which are all abelian groups.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="inline-math">$Q_8$</span> only has 1 element of order 2, but <span class="inline-math">$D_8$</span> has 5, so <span class="inline-math">$Q_8\not\isom D_8$</span>.
