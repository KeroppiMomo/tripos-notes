    We will check all three conditions of a equivalence relation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>
        Reflexivity: the identity map <span class="inline-math">$\mathrm{Id}_G: G\to G$</span> is a bijection and a homomorphism, so <span class="inline-math">$G\cong G$</span>.
    </p>
    
</li><li>
    <p>
        Symmetry: if <span class="inline-math">$G\cong H$</span>, then there exists an isomorphism <span class="inline-math">$\phi: G\to H$</span>. And by <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Lemma-inverse-of-isomorphism-is-isomorphism.html">this</a>, <span class="inline-math">$\phi^{-1}: H\to G$</span> is also an isomorphism. Therefore <span class="inline-math">$H\cong G$</span>.
    </p>
    
</li><li>
    <p>
        Transitivity: suppose <span class="inline-math">$G\xrightarrow{\phi} H\xrightarrow{\psi} K$</span> are isomorphisms. The <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Lemma-composition-of-homomorphisms.html">composition of homomorphisms</a> is a homomorphism, and the composition of bijections is a bijection, so <span class="inline-math">$\psi\circ\phi: G\to K$</span> is a homomorphism. Therefore <span class="inline-math">$G\cong K$</span>.
    </p>
    
</li>
</ul>
