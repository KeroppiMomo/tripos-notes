    If a homomorphism <span class="inline-math">$\phi: G\to H$</span> is also a bijection, then <span class="inline-math">$\phi$</span> is an isomorphism, we say that <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> is isomorphic to <span class="inline-math">$H$</span>, denoted by <span class="inline-math">$G\cong H$</span>.
