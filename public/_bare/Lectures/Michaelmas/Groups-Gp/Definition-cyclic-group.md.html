    A group <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> is a cyclic if there is some <span class="inline-math">$g\in G$</span> such that
    <span class="display-math">$$ G = \langle g\rangle = \sb{g^k}{k\in\Z}.$$</span>
    <span class="inline-math">$g$</span> is called the generator of <span class="inline-math">$G$</span>.
