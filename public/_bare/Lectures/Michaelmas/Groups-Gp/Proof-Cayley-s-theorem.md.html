    Let <span class="inline-math">$X=G$</span>. Let <span class="inline-math">$G\curvearrowright X$</span> and consider the regular action of <span class="inline-math">$G$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    By the <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Theorem-action-and-homomorphism-to-symmetry-group.html">previous theorem</a>, this gives a homomorphism
    <span class="display-math">$$ \phi: G\to\mathrm{Sym}(X). $$</span>
    Let <span class="inline-math">$H = \im\phi$</span>.
    We <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Proposition-image-and-kernel-are-subgroups.html">showed</a> that <span class="inline-math">$H\leq\mathrm{Sym}(X)$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    So we can think of <span class="inline-math">$\phi$</span> as a surjective homomorphism
    <span class="display-math">$$ \phi: G\to H. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    To show that <span class="inline-math">$\phi$</span> is injective, we will show that <span class="inline-math">$\ker\phi = \{e\}$</span>. If <span class="inline-math">$g\in\ker\phi$</span>, then
    <span class="display-math">$$\begin{align*}
    \phi(g) = \mathrm{Id}_X
    \end{align*}$$</span>
    so the definition of the regular action gives, for all <span class="inline-math">$\gamma\in G$</span>,
    <span class="display-math">$$g\cdot\gamma = \mathrm{Id}_X(\gamma) = \gamma.$$</span>
    Therefore multiplying <span class="inline-math">$\gamma^{-1}$</span> on both sides yields
    <span class="display-math">$$ g = e. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Therefore by <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Proposition-isomorphism-image-and-kernel.html">this</a>, <span class="inline-math">$\phi$</span> is a isomorphism as required.
</p>
<p>
    Since <span class="inline-math">$G=X$</span>, if <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> is finite, then <span class="inline-math">$X$</span> is also finite as required.
