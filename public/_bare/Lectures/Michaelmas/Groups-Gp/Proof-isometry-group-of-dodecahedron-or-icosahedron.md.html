    Let <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> be the isometry group of the dodecahedron, and <span class="inline-math">$G_0\leq G$</span> be the index-2 subgroup of rotational symmetries.
</p>
<p>
    Under the action of <span class="inline-math">$G_0$</span>, the orbit of a face has size 12 and the stabiliser has size 5, so
    <span class="display-math">$$ |G_0| = 12\times 5 = 60, \quad|G| = 60 \times 2 = 120. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    By drawing diagonals on the faces, we may inscribe 5 cubes into the dodecahedron, one for each of the 5 diagonals on a pentagon.

<p>
    Therefore the action on the 5 cubes leads to a homomorphism
    <span class="display-math">$$ \theta: G_0 \to S_5. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Consider rotation about an axis through opposite pairs of vertices.

    Note that two of the cubes (red and light blue) are fixed, and the other three (dark blue, green, pink) are swapped among each other (notice the triangle). Therefore this corresponds to a 3-cycle in <span class="inline-math">$\im\theta$</span>, which is in <span class="inline-math">$A_5$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    There are <span class="inline-math">$20/2 = 10$</span> such axes, and since each vertex is connected to three pentagonal faces, you can rotate by <span class="inline-math">$2\pi/3$</span> or <span class="inline-math">$4\pi/3$</span> about each of the axes.
    Hence <span class="inline-math">$\im\theta$</span> contains <span class="inline-math">$10\times 2=20$</span> 3-cycles, which is exactly how many there are in <span class="inline-math">$A_5$</span>.
    Therefore <span class="inline-math">$\im\theta$</span> contains a subgroup of <span class="inline-math">$A_5$</span> generated by 3-cycles, which is <span class="inline-math">$A_5$</span> since it is simple.
</p>
<p>
    Now
    <span class="display-math">$$ 60=|G_0| \geq |\im\theta| \geq |A_5| = 60$$</span>
    so <span class="inline-math">$\theta$</span> is an isomorphism and
    <span class="display-math">$$ G_0 \isom A_5. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    As for the cube, the map to opposite vertices <span class="inline-math">$-I \in G\setminus G_0$</span> commutes with everything, so
    <span class="display-math">$$ G \isom A_5 \times C_2. $$</span>
