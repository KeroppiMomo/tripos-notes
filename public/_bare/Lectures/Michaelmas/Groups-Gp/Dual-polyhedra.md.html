    Two solids <span class="inline-math">$x,y$</span> are dual if <span class="inline-math">$y$</span> can be constructed by putting vertices in the centres of the faces of <span class="inline-math">$x$</span> and then joining the vertices in adjacent faces by edges.

    For the Platonic solids:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>
        the tetrahedron is dual with itself;
    </p>
    
</li><li>
    <p>
        the cube and the octahedron are dual; and
    </p>
    
</li><li>
    <p>
        the dodecahedron and the icosahedron are dual.
    </p>
    
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If <span class="inline-math">$X$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$Y$</span> are dual, then <span class="inline-math">$\mrm{Isom}(X)\isom\mrm{Isom}(Y)$</span>.
