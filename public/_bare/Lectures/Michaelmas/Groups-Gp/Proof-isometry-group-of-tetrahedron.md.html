    Let <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> be the isometry group of tetrahedron and <span class="inline-math">$G_0\leq G$</span> be the index-2 subgroup of rotational symmetries.
</p>
<p>
    By <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Corollary-orbit-stabiliser.html">orbit-stabiliser</a>, under the action of <span class="inline-math">$G_0$</span>, the orbit of a face has size 4, and the stabiliser of a face has size 3 since each face is a triangle.
    Therefore
    <span class="display-math">$$ |G_0| = 4\times 3 = 12. $$</span>
    Hence
    <span class="display-math">$$ |G| = 2\times 12 = 24. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Now note that the action on the 4 vertices defines a homomorphism
    <span class="display-math">$$ \theta: G \to S_4, $$</span>
    which, by the four-point lemma, has kernel <span class="inline-math">$\set{\mrm{Id}}$</span> and is therefore injective.
</p>
<p>
    Since <span class="inline-math">$|G| = |S_4| = 24$</span>, <span class="inline-math">$\theta$</span> is an isomorphism, so
    <span class="display-math">$$ G\isom S_4. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    By the <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Lemma-uniqueness-of-A_n.html">uniqueness of <span class="inline-math">$A_4$</span></a>,
    <span class="display-math">$$ G_0 \isom A_4. $$</span>
</p>
