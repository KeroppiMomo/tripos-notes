    Let <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> be the isometry group of the cube and <span class="inline-math">$G_0\leq G$</span> be the index-2 subgroup of rotational symmetries.
</p>
<p>
    Under the action of <span class="inline-math">$G_0$</span>, the orbit of a face has size 6, and the stabiliser has size 4 since the face is a square. Therefore by <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Corollary-orbit-stabiliser.html">orbit-stabiliser</a>,
    <span class="display-math">$$ |G_0| = 6\times 4 = 24, \quad |G| = 24 \times 2 = 48.$$</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> also acts on the set of the 4 diagonals, so we have a homomorphism
    <span class="display-math">$$ \theta: G_0 \to S_4. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Recall that <span class="inline-math">$S_4$</span> is generated by <span class="inline-math">$\pmat{4\\2}=6$</span> transpositions.
</p>

    (Rotation about the orange axis by <span class="inline-math">$\pi$</span> swaps the blue diagonals but fixes the black diagonals.)
</p>
<p>
    Rotation about the mid-points of opposite pairs of edges gives <span class="inline-math">$12/2 = 6$</span> transpositions in the range of <span class="inline-math">$\theta$</span>, and therefore <span class="inline-math">$\im\theta$</span> contains all transpositions.
    Hence <span class="inline-math">$\theta$</span> is surjective and is therefore an isomorphism
    <span class="display-math">$$ G_0 \isom S_4. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Now consider the isometry that sends vertices to the opposite vertices <span class="inline-math">$-I\in G\setminus G_0$</span>. Since it commutes with everything, by the <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Groups-Gp/Theorem-direct-product-theorem.html">direct product theorem</a>,
    <span class="display-math">$$ G \isom S_4 \times C_2. $$</span>
