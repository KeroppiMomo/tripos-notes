<p>
    The order of a group <span class="inline-math">$(G,\cdot,e)$</span> is the number of elements of <span class="inline-math">$G$</span>, denoted by <span class="inline-math">$|G|$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    If <span class="inline-math">$|G|$</span> is not infinite then <span class="inline-math">$(G,\cdot,e)$</span> is a finite group.
