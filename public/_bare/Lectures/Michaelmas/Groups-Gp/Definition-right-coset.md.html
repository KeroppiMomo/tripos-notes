    Let <span class="inline-math">$H\leq G$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$\gamma\in G$</span>. The subset
    <span class="display-math">$$ H\gamma = \sb{h\gamma}{h\in H} $$</span>
    is called a right coset of <span class="inline-math">$H$</span> in <span class="inline-math">$G$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    The set of right cosets of <span class="inline-math">$H$</span> in <span class="inline-math">$G$</span> is denoted as <span class="inline-math">$H\setminus G$</span>.
