    Let <span class="inline-math">$\phi: G\to H$</span> be a homomorphism. Its image is defined as
    <span class="display-math">$$ \mathrm{im}(\phi) = \{\phi(g)\in H\mid g\in G\}. $$</span>
    Its kernel is defined as
    <span class="display-math">$$ \mathrm{ker}(\phi) = \{g\in G\mid \phi(g) = e_H\}. $$</span>
