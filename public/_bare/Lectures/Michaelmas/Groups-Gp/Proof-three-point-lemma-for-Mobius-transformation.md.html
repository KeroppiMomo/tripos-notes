    The idea of the proof is that the equation <span class="inline-math">$z = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$</span> is quadratic in <span class="inline-math">$z$</span>, so 3 distinct solutions mean that the equation is zero.
</p>
<p>
    Let <span class="inline-math">$\mu(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$w_1, w_2, w_3$</span> be the fixed points.
    A fixed point <span class="inline-math">$w_i$</span> satisfies the equation
    <span class="display-math">$$ w_i = \frac{aw_i + b}{cw_i + d}. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    If one of <span class="inline-math">$w_i$</span>, WLOG say <span class="inline-math">$w_1$</span>, equals <span class="inline-math">$\infty$</span>, then <span class="inline-math">$c=0$</span>. Then <span class="inline-math">$w_2, w_3\in\C$</span> satisfies
    <span class="display-math">$$ w_i = \frac{aw_i + b}{d}, $$</span>
    which is equivalent to
    <span class="display-math">$$(a-d)w_i + b = 0.$$</span>
    This linear equation has two distinct solutions only if
    <span class="display-math">$$ a=d, \quad b=0. $$</span>
    Therefore
    <span class="display-math">$$ \mu(z) = \frac{az + 0}{0z + a} = z. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Now suppose none of <span class="inline-math">$w_i=\infty$</span>. Then <span class="inline-math">$w_1,w_2,w_3\in\C$</span> satisfies
    <span class="display-math">$$ w_i = \frac{aw_i + b}{cw_i + d}, $$</span>
    which is equivalent to
    <span class="display-math">$$ cw_i^2 + (d-a)w_i - b = 0. $$</span>
    This is a quadratic equation but with 3 distinct solutions. Therefore
    <span class="display-math">$$ c=0,\quad d=a,\quad b=0. $$</span>
    By the same logic we have <span class="inline-math">$\mu(z) = z$</span> as required.
