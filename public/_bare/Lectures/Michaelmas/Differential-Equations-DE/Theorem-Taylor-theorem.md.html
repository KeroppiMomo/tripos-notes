<p>
    For a function <span class="inline-math">$f(x)$</span> that is <span class="inline-math">$n$</span> times differentiable at <span class="inline-math">$x_0$</span>, it differs from its <span class="inline-math">$n$</span>-th order Taylor polynomial by <span class="inline-math">$o((x-x_0)^n)$</span> as <span class="inline-math">$x\to x_0$</span>:
    <span class="display-math">$$ f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)(x-x_0)^k}{k!} + E_n $$</span>
    with <span class="inline-math">$E_n = o((x-x_0)^n)$</span>.
