    Check this condition in your head:

<p>
    Note that <span class="inline-math">$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}$</span>, so a necessary condition for an exact equation is
    <span class="display-math">$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}. $$</span>

    The theorem below says this is a sufficient condition under certain domains.
