    Consider the equation
    <span class="display-math">$$ \pdfd\psi t - c\pdfd\psi x = f(t). $$</span>
    By setting <span class="inline-math">$x = x_0 - ct$</span> (<em>characteristic</em>), and considering <span class="inline-math">$\psi(x(t), t)$</span>, the equation becomes
    <span class="display-math">$$ \dfd\psi t = f(t). $$</span>
    (<a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Differential-Equations-DE/Derivation-first-order-wave-equation.html">Derivation</a>)
</p>
<p>
    Integrating gives
    <span class="display-math">$$ \psi(x, t) = \int f(t)\, dt + g(x_0) = \int f(t)\,dt + g(x + ct) $$</span>
    where <span class="inline-math">$g$</span> is the integration constant, which can be different for each characteristic.
