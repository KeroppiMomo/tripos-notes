    If <span class="inline-math">$q(x)/p(x)$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$r(x)/p(x)$</span> are analytic at <span class="inline-math">$x=x_0$</span>, i.e. have Taylor series around <span class="inline-math">$x=x_0$</span>, then <span class="inline-math">$x=x_0$</span> is called an <em>ordinary</em> point. Otherwise it is a <em>singular</em> point.
