    General form 
    <span class="display-math">$$ y&#x27;&#x27; + p(x) y&#x27; + q(x)y = 0. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    This is hard to solve, but if we have one solution <span class="inline-math">$y_1(x)$</span>, we can find a second one <span class="inline-math">$y_2(x)$</span> by reduction of order.
