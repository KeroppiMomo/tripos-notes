<p>
    Consider <span class="inline-math">$y&#x27; = f(t,y)$</span>. Each initial condition like <span class="inline-math">$y(0) = y_0$</span> generates a distinct solution curve.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="inline-math">$f(t,y)$</span> represents the gradient of the solution curve. You can plot the slope field to visualise. You can also plot isoclines, which are curves along with <span class="inline-math">$f(t,y)$</span> is constant.
