    The first three terms of the Taylor series around <span class="inline-math">$\v x = \v x_0$</span> is
    <span class="display-math">$$ f(\v x_0 + \delta\v x) = f(\v x_0) + \delta\v x\cdot\v\nabla f\big|_{\v x_0} + \frac12 \delta\v x\ (\vnabla\vnabla f)\big|_{\v x_0}\ \delta\v x^T + \ldots $$</span>
    where <span class="inline-math">$\delta\v x$</span> is a row vector and <span class="inline-math">$\vnabla\vnabla f$</span> is the Hessian matrix
    <span class="display-math">$$ H \equiv \vnabla\vnabla f \equiv \pmat{f_{xx} &amp; f_{xy} \\ f_{yx} &amp; f_{yy}}. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    If <span class="inline-math">$f_{xy}$</span> is continuous, then <span class="inline-math">$f_{xy} = f_{yx}$</span> so <span class="inline-math">$H$</span> is symmetric.

        What is on the lecture notes has <span class="inline-math">$f_{xy}$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$f_{yx}$</span> swapped compared to Wikipedia, but I guess no one really cares which is which since it's usually symmetric.
