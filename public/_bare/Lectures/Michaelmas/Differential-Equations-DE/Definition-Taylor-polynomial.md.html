<p>
    For a function <span class="inline-math">$f(x)$</span> that is <span class="inline-math">$n$</span>-times differentiable at <span class="inline-math">$x_0$</span>,
    its <span class="inline-math">$n$</span>-th order Taylor polynomial about <span class="inline-math">$x_0$</span> is
    <span class="display-math">$$ \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k. $$</span>
