    For an <span class="inline-math">$m\times n$</span> matrix <span class="inline-math">$A$</span>, its rank is defined as <span class="inline-math">$r(A) = r(\alpha)$</span>, where <span class="inline-math">$\alpha$</span> is the associated linear map <span class="inline-math">$\alpha: \R^n \to \R^m$</span>.
