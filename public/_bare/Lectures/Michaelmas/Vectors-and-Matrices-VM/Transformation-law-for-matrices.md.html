    Consider linear map <span class="inline-math">$\alpha: \C^m \to \C^n$</span> with associated <span class="inline-math">$n\times m$</span> matrix <span class="inline-math">$A$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    To transform to a matrix that takes the input in the new basis and output a vector in the new basis, if <span class="inline-math">$P$</span> is the change-of-basis matrix of <span class="inline-math">$\C^m$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$Q$</span> is that of <span class="inline-math">$\C^n$</span>, use
    <span class="display-math">$$ A&#x27; = Q\inv A P. $$</span>

</p>
<p>
    For <span class="inline-math">$\alpha: \C^n\to\C^n$</span>, we usually transform to the same basis in domain and codomain, so
    <span class="display-math">$$ A&#x27; = P\inv AP. $$</span>
