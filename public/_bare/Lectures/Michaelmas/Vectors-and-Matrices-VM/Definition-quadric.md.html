    A quadric is an <span class="inline-math">$n$</span>-dimensional surface defined by the zero of a real quadratic polynomial, i.e. its equation is
    <span class="display-math">$$ \v x^T A\v x + \v b^T \v x + c = 0 $$</span>
    where <span class="inline-math">$A$</span> is an <span class="inline-math">$n\times n$</span> real matrix, <span class="inline-math">$\v x$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$\v b$</span> are <span class="inline-math">$n$</span>-dimensional column vectors, and <span class="inline-math">$c$</span> is a constant.
