    An <span class="inline-math">$n\times n$</span> matrix <span class="inline-math">$N$</span> is called <em>normal</em> if it commutes with its Hermitian conjugate
    <span class="display-math">$$ NN^\dagger = N^\dagger N. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Hermitian, symmetric, skew-Hermitian, anti-symmetric, orthogonal, unitary matrices are all normal.
