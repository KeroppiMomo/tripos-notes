    An <span class="inline-math">$n\times n$</span> matrix <span class="inline-math">$A$</span> is diagonalisable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix.
</p>
<p>
    Equivalently, <span class="inline-math">$A$</span> is diagonalisable if its eigenvectors form a basis of <span class="inline-math">$\C^n$</span>.
