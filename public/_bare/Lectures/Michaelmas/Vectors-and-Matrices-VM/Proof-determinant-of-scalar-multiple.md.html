    This is shown by multiplying each of the <span class="inline-math">$n$</span> columns by <span class="inline-math">$\lambda$</span>, and using the <a href="/tripos-notes/Lectures/Michaelmas/Vectors-and-Matrices-VM/Proposition-determinant-when-multiplying-a-row-or-column-by-scalar.html">fact</a> that the determinant multiplies by <span class="inline-math">$\lambda$</span> for each operation.
