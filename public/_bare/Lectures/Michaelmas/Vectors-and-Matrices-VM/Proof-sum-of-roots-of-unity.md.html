    Note that <span class="inline-math">$1,w,w^2,w^3,\ldots, w^{n-1}$</span> are all the solutions to the polynomial equation
    <span class="display-math">$$ z^n - 1 = 0, $$</span>
    the sum of roots
    <span class="display-math">$$ 1 + w + w^2 + \ldots + w^{n-1} $$</span>
    equals the <span class="inline-math">$z^{n-1}$</span> coefficient, which is 0.
