<p>
    Notice that an increasing function <span class="inline-math">$\set{1,2,\ldots,k}\to\set{1,2,\ldots,n}$</span>
    are uniquely determined by its range, which is a subset of <span class="inline-math">$\set{1,2,\ldots,n}$</span> of size <span class="inline-math">$k$</span>, and we obtain all such subsets in this way.

    Hence the number is <span class="inline-math">$\pmat{n\\k}$</span>.
