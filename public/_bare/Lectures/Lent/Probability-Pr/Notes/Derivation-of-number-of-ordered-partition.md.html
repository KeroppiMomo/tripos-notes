<p>
    Each ordered partition <span class="inline-math">$(m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_n)$</span> can be represented uniquely using <span class="inline-math">$n-1$</span> bars and <span class="inline-math">$m$</span> stars:
    <span class="display-math">$$ \ub{\texttt{*****}}_{m_1}\texttt{|}\ub{\texttt{***}}_{m_2}\texttt|\ldots\texttt|\ub{\texttt{********}}_{m_n}$$</span>
</p>
<p>
    The ordered partition is uniquely determined by the subset of <span class="inline-math">$m$</span> stars in the set of <span class="inline-math">$m+n-1$</span> symbols and we obtain all <span class="inline-math">$m$</span>-element subsets this way.
</p>
<p>
    So the number of such partitions is <span class="inline-math">$\pmat{m+n-1\\m}$</span>.
