<p>
    List the individuals in increasing order. Set <span class="inline-math">$S_0=1$</span>, and for <span class="inline-math">$n\geq 1$</span> let <span class="inline-math">$S_n$</span> for the number of offspring of all visited individuals who have not yet been visited (think about breadth-first search).
</p>
<p>
    Then the jumps of <span class="inline-math">$(S_n:n\geq0)$</span> are independent with the same distribution as <span class="inline-math">$X_1-1$</span>.
