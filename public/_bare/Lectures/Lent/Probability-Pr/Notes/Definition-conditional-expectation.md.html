<p>
    For a non-negative of integrable random variable <span class="inline-math">$X$</span> and an event <span class="inline-math">$B$</span> of positive probability, define the <em>condition expectation of <span class="inline-math">$X$</span> given <span class="inline-math">$B$</span></em> by
    <span class="display-math">$$ \expect(X|B) = \frac{\expect(X1_B)}{\prob(B)}. $$</span>
