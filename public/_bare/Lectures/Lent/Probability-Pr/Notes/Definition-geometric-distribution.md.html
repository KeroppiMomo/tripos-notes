    A <em>geometric</em> random variable <span class="inline-math">$X\sim G(p)$</span> of parameter <span class="inline-math">$p\in(0,1)$</span> has a distribution on <span class="inline-math">$\N_0=\set{0,1,2,\ldots}$</span> given by
    <span class="display-math">$$ p_k = p(1-p)^k, \quad k=0,1,2,\ldots. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively some define it as the probability measure on <span class="inline-math">$\N=\set{1,2,\dots}$</span> given by
    <span class="display-math">$$ p_k = p(1-p)^{k-1}, \quad k=1,2,\ldots. $$</span>
