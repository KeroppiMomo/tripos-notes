<p>
    The expectation of a random variable <span class="inline-math">$\v X=(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$</span> in <span class="inline-math">$\R^n$</span> is obtained by taking expectation of each of the components:
    <span class="display-math">$$ \begin{align*}
        \expect(\v X) = \left(\expect(X_1), \expect(X_2), \ldots, \expect(X_n)\right).
    \end{align*} $$</span>
