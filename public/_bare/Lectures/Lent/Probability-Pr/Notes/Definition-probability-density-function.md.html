    A function <span class="inline-math">$f$</span> on <span class="inline-math">$\R$</span> is a <em>probability density function</em> if <span class="inline-math">$f$</span> is non-negative, sufficiently regular (Borel measurable), and
    <span class="display-math">$$ \int_\R f(x)\, dx = 1. $$</span>
