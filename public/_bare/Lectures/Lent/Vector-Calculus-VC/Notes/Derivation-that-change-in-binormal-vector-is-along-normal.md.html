    Since <span class="inline-math">$1=\v b\cdot\v b$</span>, differentiating with respect to <span class="inline-math">$s$</span> gives <span class="inline-math">$\v b\cdot\dvd bs = 0$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Also <span class="inline-math">$\v t\cdot\v b=0$</span>, so differentiating,
    <span class="display-math">$$
    0 = \dvd ts\cdot\v b + \v t\cdot\dvd bs = \v n\cdot\v b + \v t\cdot\dvd bs = \v t\cdot\dvd bs.
    $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    So as <span class="inline-math">$\dvd bs\perp \v t$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$\v b$</span>, <span class="inline-math">$\dvd bs$</span> is parallel to <span class="inline-math">$\v n$</span>.
