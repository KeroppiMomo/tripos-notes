    If there is a solution to the Poisson equation on a region <span class="inline-math">$V$</span>
    with either Dirichlet or Newmann boundary conditions specified on each <span class="inline-math">$\partial V$</span>,
    then it is unique up to a constant.
</p>
<p>
    In particular if Dirichlet condition is specified anywhere, then the solution is unique.

    In general we can extend this to unbounded region with specified asymptotic boundary conditions.
