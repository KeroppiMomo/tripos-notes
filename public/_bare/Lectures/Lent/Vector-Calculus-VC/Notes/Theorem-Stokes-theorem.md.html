    Let <span class="inline-math">$S$</span> be a smooth surface in <span class="inline-math">$\R^3$</span> with boundary <span class="inline-math">$C=\partial S$</span>. For a smooth vector field <span class="inline-math">$\v F(\v x)$</span>,
    <span class="display-math">$$ \int_S (\nabla\times\v F)\cdot d\v S = \oint_C \v F\cdot d\v x. $$</span>
    The orientation is that <span class="inline-math">$d\v S\times d\v x$</span> should point outward of <span class="inline-math">$S$</span> (the orientation should be along how you curl your right hand figures around the normal vector).
</p>

    (Green's theorem is obtained by taking <span class="inline-math">$\v F=(P,Q,0)$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$S$</span> be on the <span class="inline-math">$z=0$</span> plane.)
