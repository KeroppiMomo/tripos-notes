    The tangent vectors and binormal vectors satisfy two first order differential equations (so in total six ODEs accounting the components):
    <span class="display-math">$$\begin{cases}
    \dvd ts = \kappa\v n = \kappa\v b\times\v t \\
    \dvd bs = -\tau\v n = \tau\v t\times\v b
    \end{cases}$$</span>
    So for fixed <span class="inline-math">$\kappa(s)$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$\tau(s)$</span>, there is a unique solution given some initial <span class="inline-math">$\v b(0)$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$\v t(0)$</span>.

    Hence the curvature and torsion function specifies a curve up to rotation and translation.
