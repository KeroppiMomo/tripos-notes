<p>
    There are two linearly independent vectors <span class="inline-math">$\v m_1$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$\v m_2$</span> that lie tangent to the surface.
    Since <span class="inline-math">$\v m_i\cdot\nabla F$</span> is the rate of change of <span class="inline-math">$F(\v x)$</span> in the direction of <span class="inline-math">$\v m_i$</span>,
    <span class="display-math">$$ m_i \cdot \nabla F = 0. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    Therefore since the normal vector <span class="inline-math">$\v n$</span> is perpendicular to both <span class="inline-math">$\v m_1$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$\v m_2$</span>, <span class="inline-math">$\v n$</span> is parallel to <span class="inline-math">$\nabla F$</span>.
