    Let <span class="inline-math">$\v x(s)$</span> be a parametrisation by the arc length.
    The curvature is
    <span class="display-math">$$ \kappa(s) = \bigg|\dvd[2]xs\bigg| = \bigg|\dvd ts\bigg| $$</span>
    where <span class="inline-math">$\v t = d\v x/ds$</span> is the unit tangent vector.
