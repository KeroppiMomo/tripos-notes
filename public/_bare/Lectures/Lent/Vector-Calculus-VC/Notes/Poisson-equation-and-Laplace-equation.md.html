    In static conditions, gravitational field <span class="inline-math">$\v g$</span> and electric field <span class="inline-math">$\v E$</span> are conservative, so the potentials of the fields satisfy the Poisson equation.
</p>
<p>
    Solutions to the Laplace equation <span class="inline-math">$\nabla^2\psi=0$</span> are called <em>harmonic functions</em>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>
        <span class="inline-math">$\nabla^2$</span> is linear, so sum of solutions is also a solution.
        Solutions to Laplace equation are complementary solutions to Poisson.
