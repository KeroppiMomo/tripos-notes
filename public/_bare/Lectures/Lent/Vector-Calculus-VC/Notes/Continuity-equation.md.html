    Suppose a physical quantity is conserved <em>locally</em>, which means that if the total quantity inside some region <span class="inline-math">$V$</span> decreases at some rate, then the flux out of the region should be at that rate.
</p>
<p>
    More specifically, if <span class="inline-math">$\rho(\v x,t)$</span> is the density and <span class="inline-math">$\v J(\v x,t)$</span> is the current density,
    <span class="display-math">$$ \pdd t \int_V \rho\,dV = -\int_{\partial V}\v J\cdot d\v S. $$</span>
    Using the divergence theorem, we obtain the continuity equation
    <span class="display-math">$$ \pdfd\rho t + \nabla\cdot\v J = 0. $$</span>
