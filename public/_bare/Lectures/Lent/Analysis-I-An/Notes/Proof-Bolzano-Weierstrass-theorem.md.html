    We perform bisection to find nested intervals that contain infinitely many elements in the sequence as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>
        Step 1: set <span class="inline-math">$a_1=-K$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$b_1=K$</span> so that all terms of <span class="inline-math">$(x_n)$</span> lie in <span class="inline-math">$[a_1, b_1]$</span>.
    </p>
    
</li><li>
    <p>
        Step <span class="inline-math">$n$</span>: let <span class="inline-math">$c_{n-1} = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})/2$</span>. Since there is infinitely many terms in <span class="inline-math">$[a_{n-1}, b_{n-1}]$</span>,
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            there are infinitely many terms in <span class="inline-math">$[a_{n-1}, c_{n-1}]$</span>, in which case set <span class="inline-math">$a_n = a_{n-1}$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$b_n=c_{n-1}$</span>; or
        </p>
        
    </li><li>
        <p>
            there are infinitely many terms in <span class="inline-math">$[c_{n-1}, b_{n-1}]$</span>, in which case set <span class="inline-math">$a_n = c_{n-1}$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$b_n = b_{n-1}$</span>.
        </p>
        
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Then there are infinitely many terms of <span class="inline-math">$(x_n)$</span> lying in <span class="inline-math">$[a_n, b_n]$</span>, <span class="inline-math">$b_n-a_n = (b_{n-1} - a_{n-1})/2$</span>, and <span class="inline-math">$a_{n-1}\leq a_n &lt; b_n \leq b_{n-1}$</span>.
    </p>
    
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    By construction, <span class="inline-math">$a_n$</span> is increasing and bounded above by <span class="inline-math">$b_1$</span>, so <span class="inline-math">$a_n \to a$</span> for some <span class="inline-math">$a\in[a_1,b_1]$</span> as <span class="inline-math">$n\to\infty$</span>.
    Similarly <span class="inline-math">$b_n$</span> is decreasing and bounded below by <span class="inline-math">$a_1$</span>, so <span class="inline-math">$b_n\to b$</span> for some <span class="inline-math">$b\in[a_1, b_1]$</span> as <span class="inline-math">$n\to\infty$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    But <span class="inline-math">$b_n - a_n = (b_{n-1} - a_{n-1})/2$</span>, so by taking limits on both sides, <span class="inline-math">$b-a = (b-a)/2$</span> so <span class="inline-math">$a=b$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Now construct the subsequence as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>
        Pick <span class="inline-math">$n_1 = 1$</span>.
    </p>
    
</li><li>
    <p>
        Pick <span class="inline-math">$n_j$</span> to be the smallest integer larger than <span class="inline-math">$n_{j-1}$</span> such that <span class="inline-math">$x_{n_j} \in [a_j, b_j]$</span>. This is always possible since <span class="inline-math">$[a_j, b_j]$</span> contains infinitely many terms in the sequence.
    </p>
    
</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Notice that <span class="inline-math">$a_j \leq x_{n_j} \leq b_j$</span>, so by squeeze theorem, <span class="inline-math">$x_{n_j} \to a$</span>.
</p>
