    By the inverse function theorem, since <span class="inline-math">$\exp$</span> is strictly increasing and differentiable everywhere, so is <span class="inline-math">$\log$</span> with
    <span class="display-math">$$ \log&#x27;(t) = \frac{1}{\exp&#x27;(\log(t))} = \frac1{\exp(\log(t))} = \frac1t.$$</span>
