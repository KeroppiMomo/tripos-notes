    Define <span class="inline-math">$\exp: \mathbb C\to\mathbb C$</span> with
    <span class="display-math">$$ \exp(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!} = 1 + z + \frac{1}{2!}z^2 + \frac{1}{3!}z^3 + \ldots. $$</span>
</p>
<p>
    This is well-defined as the series has a radius of convergence of <span class="inline-math">$\infty$</span>, since <span class="inline-math">$|a_{n+1}/a_n| = |k!/(k+1)!| = 1/(k+1) \to 0$</span>.
</p>
