    Suppose <span class="inline-math">$(z_n)$</span> is any sequence of points in <span class="inline-math">$A$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$z_n \to a$</span>.
    By the continuity of <span class="inline-math">$f$</span> at <span class="inline-math">$a$</span>, <span class="inline-math">$f(z_n) \to f(a)$</span>, and by the continuity of <span class="inline-math">$g$</span> at <span class="inline-math">$f(a)$</span>, <span class="inline-math">$g\big(f(z_n)\big) \to g\big(f(a)\big)$</span>.
