    Suppose <span class="inline-math">$f: [a,b]\to\R$</span> is continuous and strictly increasing. Let <span class="inline-math">$c=f(a)$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$d=f(b)$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Then <span class="inline-math">$f: [a,b]\to[c,d]$</span> is a bijection, and <span class="inline-math">$f\inv: [c,d]\to[a,b]$</span> is continuous and strictly increasing.
