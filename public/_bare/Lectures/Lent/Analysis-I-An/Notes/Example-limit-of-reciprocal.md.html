    Show that <span class="inline-math">$1/n\to 0$</span> as <span class="inline-math">$n\to\infty$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="inline-math">$(1/n)_{n\in\N}$</span> is a decreasing sequence bounded below by 0, so it has a limit <span class="inline-math">$L$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Consider <span class="inline-math">$(1/2n)_{n\in\N}$</span>.
    <span class="inline-math">$1/2n = (1/n)/2 \to L/2$</span>, but also it is a subsequence of <span class="inline-math">$(1/n)_{n\in\N}$</span>, so <span class="inline-math">$1/2n\to L$</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Since limit is unique, <span class="inline-math">$L=L/2$</span> so <span class="inline-math">$L=0$</span>.
</p>
