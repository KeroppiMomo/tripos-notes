    Suppose <span class="inline-math">$A,B\subseteq\C$</span>, <span class="inline-math">$f:A\to B$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$g: B\to\C$</span>.
    If <span class="inline-math">$f$</span> is continuous at <span class="inline-math">$a\in A$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$g$</span> is continuous at <span class="inline-math">$f(a) \in B$</span>, then <span class="inline-math">$g\circ f: A\to\C$</span> is continuous at <span class="inline-math">$a$</span>.
