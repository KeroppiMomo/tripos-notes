<p>
    A bounded function <span class="inline-math">$f: [a,b]\to\R$</span> is piecewise continuous if
    there exists a dissection <span class="inline-math">$\mathcal{D}$</span> of <span class="inline-math">$[a,b]$</span> such that for each <span class="inline-math">$i=1,2,\ldots,n$</span>,
    the restriction <span class="inline-math">$f_i: (x_{i-1}, x_i) \to \R$</span> is continuous and has limit as <span class="inline-math">$x\to x_{i-1}$</span> and <span class="inline-math">$x\to x_i$</span>.
